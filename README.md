Hi Everyone!

My name is Lalit Gupta. I have been working in the software industry, primarily on Enterprise Solutions, for over a decade now. I am recently enthused with the advancements into the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. To further my understanding and possibly to make some contributions to the field I have embarked on this journey to learn and use the fundamentals and concepts of ML and AI to provide solutions to enterprises and business problems.

To that end in mind I have come accross GitHub and will be using it to maintain and manage my progess and code.
